## Getting started with halguru

### Create your first AI agent

```bash
halguru create --agent-file agentname
```

Where, **agentname** - this is the name of your agent AI

### Setup yaml file

A yaml file called agentname.halguru will be created in the current catalog. With any editor,
e.g. **Visual Studio Code**, you can change all its settings.

```yaml

  file-purpose: the file contains the AI robot configuration for the hal.guru platform
  platform-version: 1.0
agent:
  name: My life advisor
